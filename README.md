# Pong4All
The following project was developed for the Distributed Systems class of SDIS in the Faculty of Engineering and University of Porto(FEUP).

The project's purpose is to develop a distributed system application with a P2P and/or client&server format.

Basically, it's a 3D pong game for 2 to 4 players made in Unity3D with C# with a game tracker server made in Java.

##### About the game
> Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left side of the screen, and can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The aim is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
